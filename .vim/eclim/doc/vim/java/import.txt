Automated Imports
*****************

*:JavaImport*

The automated import functionality is pretty straightforward.  Simply
place the cursor over the element to import and issue the command:

   :JavaImport

and one of the following events will occur:

- If only one matching element is found, its import statement will be
  placed in the file.

- If multiple matching elements are found, you will be prompted to
  choose the element you wish to import from a list.

- If an element with the same name is already imported, the element is
  in java.lang, or the element is in the same package as the current
  src file, then a simple prompt will alert you that the element does
  not need to be imported.

In addition to importing elements, the plugin provides two additional
commands:

*:JavaImportSort*

- :JavaImportSort - Sorts the import statements in alphabetical order
  with java and javax imports first.

*:JavaImportClean*

- :JavaImportClean - Removes any un-used import statements.  If the
  current file is not in an Eclipse project, then a Vim only
  implementation is invoked, that behaves the same as the server side
  version, except it does not take into account object names that are
  commented out.
