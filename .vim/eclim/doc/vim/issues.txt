Issues / Quirks
***************

Some portions of eclim make use of the editing APIs provided by
Eclipse.  While this makes for much cleaner code and far fewer chances
of errors while trying to accomodate everyone's coding style, or other
issues, it does have its drawbacks:

- Undo:

  When changes to the source file are made outside of Vim, the plugin
  must issue a :edit on the file to force Vim to re-read the now
  updated file.  The downside is that Vim clears the undo tree when
  the file is re-read.  I'll be looking into ways to remedy this
  situation and also talking with the Vim developers to see if perhaps
  some changes to Vim 7 may facilitate a solution as well.

  Note: I had some email correspondence with Bram on this issue and it has
    made it into the Vim todo list (:h todo).

       "See ":e" as a change operation, find the changes and add them
       to the undo info.  Needed for when an external tool changes the
       file."

7. Formatting (tabs vs. spaces):

  When inserting new code eclim will always use tabs and the
  corresponding Vim plugin will issue a :retab on the new code so that
  the user's Vim settings will reformat the code to the user's chosen
  preference.  However, Eclipse gets in the way a little bit here.
  Eclipse defaults to tabs for all indentation, so if that is how your
  Vim options are setup then you probably don't have anything to worry
  about.

  If you instead have Vim setup to expand tabs to spaces, then you may
  encounter times when Eclipse will insert the code with no
  indentation.

  To resolve this you will need to edit some settings in Eclipse:

  1. Shutdown eclimd.

  2. Open Eclipse.

  3. Under the "Window" menu choose "Preferences"

  4. Expand the "Java" node and then the "Code Style" node in the tree
     on the left.

  5. Click on the "Formatter" item under the "Code Style" node.

  6. Click the "New" button to create a new formatter profile (I named
     my "eclim") and then click "OK".

  7. When the "Edit Profile" window comes up, you should be on the
     "Indentation" tab where you can edit the tab policy.  Change it
     to match your Vim settings (note: using Mixed may or may not work
     all the time). When using "Spaces only" be sure to set the
     "Indentation size" and "Tab size" to your preference.

  This should fix any known indentation issues, but if you encounter
  any other problems just send me a sample file along with your Vim
  and Eclipse settings so that I can attempt to reproduce and fix the
  problem.
