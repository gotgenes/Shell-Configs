*eclim_workspace*

- How to I tell eclim which eclipse workspace to use?

  To configure the workspace you can start eclimd like so:

     >

        $ eclimd -Dosgi.instance.area.default=@user.home/another_workspace

     <


  Note the system property osgi.instance.area.default, which is used
  to specify the location of your workspace.  Also note the variable
  @user.home which will be replaced with your home directory at
  runtime.

  If you are running a unix variant (linux, mac osx, bsd, etc.) then
  you can specify the above system property in the .eclimrc file in
  your home directory.

     >

        $ echo "osgi.instance.area.default=@user.home/another_workspace" >> ~/.eclimrc

     <


*eclim_proxy*

- How can I configure eclim to use a proxy?

  The occasional eclim feature requires network access to function
  properly. For example, xml validation may require validating the
  file against a dtd or xsd located remotely.  If you are behind a
  proxy then you may need to provide eclim with the necessary proxy
  settings.

        $ eclimd -Dhttp.proxyHost=my.proxy -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080
